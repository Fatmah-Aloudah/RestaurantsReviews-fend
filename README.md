# RestaurantsReviews-fend
The final project of Front-End-Nanodegree from Udacity

# The Idea
The Restaurant Reviews project is about editing the webpage to show a map with all Restaurant and to edit js files to show the Restaurants under the map with their information. In addition if the user click on one of the Restaurants, he or she will redirect to the Restaurant page showing the Restaurant name, image, type, working hours, and people reviews. The project has to Implement accessibility features and use Service Worker for creating a seamless offline experience for users.
